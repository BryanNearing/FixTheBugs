There are 3 bugs that were fixed in this program and are listed as follows

1) The search method was not implemented
	The fix for this was just passing the arraylist to the search method. 
	After this, the method then iterates through all of the expenses and if it is present, it says so and tells the user the index.
2) The sort method was not implemented
	The fix for this was again passing the arraylist to the sort method.
	The expenses are sorted in ascending order using the Collection.sort() method;
3) Expense values are constantly overwritten
	The fix for this was simply moving the instatiation of the arraylist and the code that fills it to the main method above the optionSelection method.
	After this, the optionsSelection method was modified to accept the expense and arrList arraylists and the values are now not overwritten every time the menu is called.
